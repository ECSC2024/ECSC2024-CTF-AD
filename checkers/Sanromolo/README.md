# Sanromolo - Checker

The checker is implemented as a runnable Python 3 module. It depends on the
Python packages listed in [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt) to run.

See [`./test_checker.sh`](./test_checker.sh) for manual invocation for testing
purposes. See also [`./test_forever.sh`](./test_forever.sh) to run the checks
forever in a loop saving errors locally.
